Getting lost at a red light it seems to me
Getting near to a dead end that don't exist
Worrying all the things ahead of yourself
But why? I don't get it at all

Everything falls apart at some point in time
Gotta let go some of those fix itself in the meanwhile
Even you, even me, we all have to rest
Please don't let this just go on

Just realize that you can pull this through, just look up

Between the sky's blue
Let's paint the stars the hope that we have
Out there for them to see that we could be the things we dream
Just gotta have faith (faith)
And those stars will reform into a constellation
It will fall right into place, it's set and stoned
When time arrives (when time arrives)
You will be just fine like those stars you choose
Between the blue and sky

No matter how long will it take, no matter how hard will it be
I will keep on looking over you while I still got your back
Our journey is not over, I'll keep pushing even if you are fine

Between the sky's blue
It isn't so faraway to reach it
I know I'm not alone to be here
Look up, that's where we belong

Between the sky's blue
Let's paint the stars the hope that we have
Out there for them to see that we could be the things we dream
Just gotta have faith (faith)
And those stars will reform into a constellation
It will fall right into place, it's set and stoned
When time arrives (when time arrives)
You will be just fine like those stars you choose
Between the blue and sky
